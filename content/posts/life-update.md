## Stuff can be tiring yet rewarding

Some weeks ago, kuya Jay approached me on my plans regarding college and my career. Said I wasn't prepared yet for college so I was planning to get a job first to get decent gear. Like a lot of people that really wanted to get a job too, I'm very excited. The thought of saving up for new stuff I can use really is exciting and I want to commit to it. One thing he said to me was to value what I already have and still planning to even take further, education. "People will not respect you unless you have a diploma," and boy did it hit me hard. I reassessed myself on what my capabilities are and how I see school, not just because of my worry to be respected, like how a human should act, but on how this will affect my future.

Anyway, I can still say that it's a nice time to live out your fullest, still. I managed to focus on my programming studies for quite a lot of hours now and I can say that I've never been this productive.
