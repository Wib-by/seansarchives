## I'm starting therapy

After a conversation with my psychiatrist, it was concluded that I needed a nAch/TAT exam to have my motivation, energy, and short-term goals and prospects analyzed in order to aid theraputic processes to help my college journey. I have to admit, it sounds like a big step, but I'm all up for it anyway. Looking back at how I "fumbled" senior high school, this was my only hope of surviving college and my future programming career.



Bothered with failures which I coped with, I can say for myself that I'm aware I haven't done enough practically. As mentioned with my past blog, reviving myself wasn't so hard with being productive with the things I'm interested in. Though one problem comes to mind-- how about the thing's that I'm ***NOT*** interested in?



Life's crazy, but I'm glad therapy can be there to slow things down a bit, haha.
