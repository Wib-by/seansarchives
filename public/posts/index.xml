      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;stuff-can-be-tiring-yet-rewarding&#34;&gt;Stuff can be tiring yet rewarding&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some weeks ago, kuya Jay approached me on my plans regarding college and my career. Said I wasn&amp;rsquo;t prepared yet for college so I was planning to get a job first to get decent gear. Like a lot of people that really wanted to get a job too, I&amp;rsquo;m very excited. The thought of saving up for new stuff I can use really is exciting and I want to commit to it. One thing he said to me was to value what I already have and still planning to even take further, education. &amp;ldquo;People will not respect you unless you have a diploma,&amp;rdquo; and boy did it hit me hard. I reassessed myself on what my capabilities are and how I see school, not just because of my worry to be respected, like how a human should act, but on how this will affect my future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
